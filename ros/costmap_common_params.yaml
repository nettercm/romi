# The maximum range in meters at which to insert obstacles into the costmap using sensor data

# The maximum range in meters at which to raytrace out obstacles from the map using sensor data

# The radius of the robot in meters
robot_radius: 0.12

# Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds.
# This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing
# an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system.
# For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a
# transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the coordinate
# frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance
# seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack will stop the robot.
